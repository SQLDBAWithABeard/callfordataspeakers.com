This is a placeholder for a future documentation of this project. The short version is:
I built a site to connect data platform conferences to speakers in their region. Speakers
can register in a Mailchimp mailing list, with regional preferences. Organizers can
request a one-time mailing announcing their event to speakers in specific regions.

## Front-end web

The frontend is built on Node.js, hosted as an Azure WebApp behind a Cloudfront CDN.

## Database

A tiny database backend keeps track of requested conference emails.

## Pull requests welcome.

I am not what you would call a web developer, so any help would be appreciated if you
see anything that needs fixing.
